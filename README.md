# cart-builder

The goal with cart-builder is to simplify our weekly grocery order routine, so
that we don't have to scroll through the entire Kroger website every time.
Instead, we would ideally just look at a list, adjust numbers, and submit.

## Workflow

This application should:

1. Authenticate against the Kroger API.
2. Load a default schedule of your weekly grocery order.
3. Ask you to edit this interactively, to adjust the order.
4. On submit, create a new cart, and add each item to the cart.
5. Provide a link to the cart to finalize the order.
